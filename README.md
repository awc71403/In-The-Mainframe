# In The Mainframe
 
This was a multiplayer game that I coded by myself. In this project I learned how to make my first 3D game as wella s my first actual multiplayer game.

Utilizing Photon and watching countless videos, I was able to communicate information between different clients since modifying Player A on Client A would not change Player A for other clients.

In this game, you either play as a virus (survivor) or the firewall (killer) in this hide and seek type game. The goal of the viruses is to finish objectives by "hacking" in order to get into the mainframe while the firewall tries to stop the viruses.
